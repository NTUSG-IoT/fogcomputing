It was believed that if an attacker can replay the exact same signal of a legitimate authentication object (such as an RFID tag), any physical-layer authentication method will fail. We present Hu-Fu, the first physical layer RFID authentication protocol that is resilient to the major attacks including tag counterfeiting, signal replay, signal compensation, and brute-force feature reply. Hu-Fu is built on two fundamental ideas, namely inductive coupling of two tags and signal randomization. Hu-Fu does not require any hardware or protocol modification and can be implemented with COTS devices. We implement a prototype of Hu-Fu and demonstrate that it is accurate and robust to device diversity and environmental changes, including locations, distance, and temperature. Hu-Fu provides a new direction of battery-free/low-power device authentication that enables numerous IoT applications.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Jinsong Han is a professor at the Institute of Cyberspace Research, College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University.

A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a simple analog-to-digital converter only, which is widely available on microcontrollers. Compared with existing approaches including intra-body communication and physiological sensing, TouchAuth is a low-cost, lightweight, and convenient approach for the authorized users to access the smart objects found in indoor environments.</td>

<td align="left"><strong>Invited talk</strong>: Real-Time Data Stream Processing on Multi-Core Architectures<br>By <strong>Assoc Prof Bingsheng He</strong> (National University of Singapore)<br><img class="special-img-class" src="img/5_He.png" style="width:25%"/><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce BriskStream, an in-memory data stream processing (DSP) system specifically designed for efficient stream computation on shared-memory multi-socket multicores. BriskStream is developed based on the code-base of Storm and supports the same APIs. It inherits the basic architectures including pipelined processing and operator replication designs of modern DSP systems. In particular, each operator runs independently in a dedicated Java thread and its replication and placement (i.e., CPU affinity in our context) can be configured in different execution plans. BriskStream&rsquo;s key contribution is an execution plan optimization paradigm, which takes relative-location of each pair of producer-consumer operators in non-uniform memory access (NUMA) into consideration. As far as we are concerned, the resulting nontrivial placement optimization problem has not been previously studied on in-memory DSP. We show a branch and bound based approach with several heuristics to resolve the concerned problem. We also propose a simple iterative-based approach to identify the final execution plan considering both operator replication and placement configurations. Besides our NUMA-aware execution plan optimization paradigm, BriskStream also contains several nontrivial modifications that are specifically optimized for shared-memory multi-core architectures. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that BriskStream significantly outperforms the existing DSP systems including Apache Storm and Flink on shared-memory multicores server with eight CPU sockets, up to an order of magnitude of performance speedup.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Dr. Bingsheng He is currently an Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore.

<td align="left"><strong>Invited talk</strong>: DRS: Resource Auto-Scaling for Real-Time Stream Analytics<br>By <strong>Dr. Tom Z.J. Fu</strong> (Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Illinois at Singapore)<br><img class="special-img-class" src="img/6_Fu.jpg" style="width:25%"/><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: We propose DRS, a dynamic resource scaling framework for cloud-based stream data analytics systems. DRS overcomes three fundamental challenges: (i) how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources and the application performance, (ii) where to best place resources, and (iii) how to measure the system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes an accurate performance model based on the theory of Jackson open queueing networks and is capable of handling arbitrary operator topologies, possibly with loops, splits and joins. Extensive experiments with real data show that DRS is capable of detecting sub-optimal resource allocation and making quick and effective resource adjustment.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Tom Z. J.

<td align="left"><strong>Student presentation 2</strong>: Randomization of flow paths in real-time WirelessHART networks<br>By <strong>Ankita Samaddar</strong> (Nanyang Technological University)<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Time-critical systems such as industrial process control systems need to guarantee reliable communication between sensors and  actuators to maintain safe operation of all the components of the system. WirelessHART is a wireless sensor actuator network standard that is most widely adopted as the medium of communication in these industrial setups as it provides reliable communication by supporting Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based real-time communication, availability of multiple channels, channel hopping, centralized architecture, redundant routes and avoidance of spatial re-use of channels. However, the communication schedule in WirelessHART is decided by a centralized network manager at the time of network initialization and the same schedule is repeated at every hyper-period. Due to the predictability of time slots in the communication schedule, an adversary can extract timing information from the system and launch timing attacks into the system. Scheduling in real-time WirelessHART network is a NP-hard problem. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm - the SlotSwapper for multi-channel WirelessHART networks that uses schedule randomization techniques to randomize the time slots in the schedule preserving all the feasibility constraints of a real-time WirelessHART network and makes the schedule uncertain over every hyper-period of time. We measure the degree of uncertainty in the schedules generated by our algorithms in terms of randomness in the slots of the newly generated schedules. We also use K-L divergence as a metric to measure the divergence of our solution w.r.t. truly random solution.<br><strong>Student presentation 3</strong>: Differentially Private Collaborative Learning for the IoT Edge<br><br>By <strong>Linshan Jiang</strong> (Nanyang Technological University)<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Collaborative learning based on training data contributed by many edge devices is a promising paradigm for implementing crowd intelligence. The collaboratively trained model generally provides superior classification performance due to the increased volume and expanded coverage of the training data. However, the data contribution may incur the concern of privacy breach. This paper presents the design of a privacy-preserving collaborative learning approach, in which the edge devices and the cloud train different stages of a deep neural network, and the data transmitted from an edge device to the honest-but-curious cloud is perturbed by Laplacian random noises to achieve ε-differential privacy. We apply the proposed approach to a case study of collaboratively training a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit recognition. The results show that our approach maintains 99% and 96% classification accuracy in implementing privacy loss levels of ε = 5 and ε = 2, respectively.</td>
