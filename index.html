<td align="left"><strong>Invited talk</strong>: Trusted “Embedded” Edge/Fog Computing ― Architecture, Technology and Implementation<br>By <strong>Prof John Kar-kin Zao</strong> (National Chiao Tung University)<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edge and Fog Computing aim at dispersing Cloud Computing services along the IoT-to-Cloud Continuum. To achieving this goal, Edge/Fog Computing architecture must ensure Trustworthiness of the Edge/Fog Nodes “embedded” into the Internet infrastructure and offer ambient end-to-end Information Security services throughout their communication fabric. In this talk, we expound the concept of Trusted “Embedded” Mixed-Computing Edge/Fog Nodes and the necessary technology to build these essential Dispersive Computing entities. We will also explore the ways to make our existing Fog Nodes “Trustworthy” and work with IEEE Standard Association and GlobalPlatform to develop the necessary standards.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Prof. Zao is the founding chairman of the IEEE 1934 Standard Working Group on Fog Computing and Networking Architecture Framework and the founding vice-chairman of the new IEEE Standard Committee on Edge/Fog/Cloud Communications with IoT and Big Data. He is also the co-chairman of the Security Working Group of OpenFog Consortium and its Greater China Regional Committee.

<td align="left"><strong>Invited talk</strong>: Advantages and Risks of Sensing for Cyber-Physical Security<br>By <strong>Asst Prof Jun Han</strong> (National University of Singapore)<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), we are witnessing a wealth of exciting applications that enable computational devices to interact with the physical world via overwhelming number of sensors and actuators. However, such interactions pose new challenges to traditional approaches of security and privacy. In this talk, I will present how I utilize sensor data to provide security and privacy protections for IoT/CPS scenarios, and further introduce novel security threats arising from similar sensor data. Specifically, I will highlight three of my recent projects that leverage sensor data for defense and attack scenarios in applications such as smart homes and semi-autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, I will introduce my future research directions such as identifying and defending against unforeseen security challenges from newer application domains such as smart vehicles, buildings, and cities.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Jun Han is an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore with appointment in the Computer Science Department, School of Computing. His research interests lie at the intersection of sensing systems and security, and focuses on utilizing contextual information for security applications in the Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. He publishes across various research communities spanning security, sensing systems, and mobile computing (including S&amp;P/Oakland, CCS, IPSN, TOSN, and HotMobile). He received his Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University as a member of Mobile, Embedded, and Wireless (MEWS) Group.

<td align="left"><strong>Invited talk</strong>: Real-Time Data Stream Processing on Multi-Core Architectures<br>By <strong>Assoc Prof Bingsheng He</strong> (National University of Singapore)<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce BriskStream, an in-memory data stream processing (DSP) system specifically designed for efficient stream computation on shared-memory multi-socket multicores. BriskStream is developed based on the code-base of Storm and supports the same APIs. It inherits the basic architectures including pipelined processing and operator replication designs of modern DSP systems. In particular, each operator runs independently in a dedicated Java thread and its replication and placement (i.e., CPU affinity in our context) can be configured in different execution plans. BriskStream&rsquo;s key contribution is an execution plan optimization paradigm, which takes relative-location of each pair of producer-consumer operators in non-uniform memory access (NUMA) into consideration. As far as we are concerned, the resulting nontrivial placement optimization problem has not been previously studied on in-memory DSP. We show a branch and bound based approach with several heuristics to resolve the concerned problem. We also propose a simple iterative-based approach to identify the final execution plan considering both operator replication and placement configurations. Besides our NUMA-aware execution plan optimization paradigm, BriskStream also contains several nontrivial modifications that are specifically optimized for shared-memory multi-core architectures. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that BriskStream significantly outperforms the existing DSP systems including Apache Storm and Flink on shared-memory multicores server with eight CPU sockets, up to an order of magnitude of performance speedup.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Dr. Bingsheng He is currently an Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore. Before that, he was a faculty member in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (2010-2016), and held a research position in the System Research group of Microsoft Research Asia (2008-2010), where his major research was building high performance cloud computing systems for Microsoft. He got the Bachelor degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (1999-2003), and the Ph.D. degree in Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology (2003-2008). His current research interests include cloud computing, database systems and high performance computing. His papers are published in prestigious international journals (such as ACM TODS and IEEE TKDE/TPDS/TC) and proceedings (such as ACM SIGMOD, VLDB/PVLDB, ACM/IEEE SuperComputing, ACM HPDC, and ACM SoCC). He has been awarded with the IBM Ph.D. fellowship (2007-2008) and with NVIDIA Academic Partnership (2010-2011). Since 2010, he has (co-)chaired a number of international conferences and workshops, including IEEE CloudCom <sup>2014</sup>&frasl;<sub>2015</sub> and BigData Congress 2018.

<td align="left"><strong>Invited talk</strong>: DRS: Resource Auto-Scaling for Real-Time Stream Analytics<br>By <strong>Dr. Tom Z.J. Fu</strong> (Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Illinois at Singapore)<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: We propose DRS, a dynamic resource scaling framework for cloud-based stream data analytics systems. DRS overcomes three fundamental challenges: (i) how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources and the application performance, (ii) where to best place resources, and (iii) how to measure the system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes an accurate performance model based on the theory of Jackson open queueing networks and is capable of handling arbitrary operator topologies, possibly with loops, splits and joins. Extensive experiments with real data show that DRS is capable of detecting sub-optimal resource allocation and making quick and effective resource adjustment.<br><strong>Bio</strong>: Tom Z. J. Fu obtained the B.Eng degree in Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2006. He received the M.Phil and the Ph.D degrees from the Department of Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2008 and 2013, respectively. In Oct 2013, he joined Advanced Digital Sciences Center, a Singapore-based research center established by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and currently he is a senior research scientist &amp; analytics area programme manager. His research interests include cloud computing, real-time distributed stream analytics, software defined networking (SDN), Internet measurement and monitoring, Peer-to-Peer content distribution.</td>
